# SlitExperiment

SlitExpriment is a VPython code that simulates classic wave particle reflection on slit ( This does not most likely mean what you think: in this context it is more like an imaginary Classic ping bong ball moving in a sin trajectory and reflecting from slit inner side top or bottom walls to an angle, that it's tangent has during the collision).  

Ball moving fwd in sin wave. When it hits the slit it gets either blocked or goes directly through or it hits the slit  top/bottom inside and relfects.  
When reflecting, the sin wave changes it's direction by an angle that it's tangent (derivate) has when hitting the top or floor walls of the slit.   

Rflection is calculated bu using the Rotation matrix and then adjusting the x and y position to start from the same point from where the reflection occured.   

Totally useless experiment, but fun. As I'm not expert of the VPyton or Python. Most of the code is generated by ChatGPT.

## Initial state of a wave
Ball waves starts with Random phase in order to get some variance to end result.
It has also random amplitude which I believe kind of simulates statistically 3D waves on R^3 (rotation along x axis).   
Wavelenght is however allways same in this code.  


## Result after 300 samples

## Things to do
* Reflection in slit is still far from perfect. There is a clear uncontinnuity still after adding an extra phase shift to reflection
* original Sin wave is now moving along the x axsis. it could vary so that the direction would have slightly variating angle towards x-axsis, like  +/- pi/4.
* it would save alot of simulation time if software would filter out beforehand all runs that does not end up into the sample wall.   




## Modifications:
### Extra Phase shift on reflection
* Compute the new phase: When the ball diffracts through the slit, we calculate a new phase shift (new_phase_shift) using the sine of the y-value at the diffraction point. This ensures the sine wave continues smoothly.

* Continuous trajectory: By adjusting the phase, the sine wave naturally "picks up" where it left off, avoiding a sudden jump or shift in the wave.

#### How It Works:
Before Diffraction: The ball follows the normal sine wave trajectory.   
At Diffraction Point: When the ball passes through the slit, we calculate the angle (using the tangent) and adjust the wave's phase so that the sine wave continues smoothly, accounting for the diffraction effect.   
After Diffraction: The sine wave continues, but its phase has been shifted to ensure a smooth transition.   
This approach will ensure a more natural and continuous transition at the slit, without a noticeable shift or break in the wave trajectory.
