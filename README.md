# SlitExperiment
SlitExpriment is a VPython code that simulates classic wave particle reflection on slit

Ball moving fwd in sin wave. When it hits the slit it gets either blocked or goes directly through or if it hits the slit inside the gap, then it changes it's direction by an angle that it's tangent (derivate) has when hitting the top or floor of the slit.   

Totally useless experiment, but fun. As I'm not expert of the VPyton or Python. Most of the code is generated by ChatGPT.
