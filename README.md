# SlitExperiment
SlitExpriment is a VPython code that simulates classic wave particle reflection on slit

Ball moving fwd in sin wave. When it hits the slit it gets either blocked or goes directly through or if it hits the slit inside the gap, then it changes it's direction by an angle that it's tangent (derivate) has when hitting the top or floor of the slit.   

Totally useless experiment, but fun. As I'm not expert of the VPyton or Python. Most of the code is generated by ChatGPT.   

## Things to do
* Reflection in slit is still far from perfect.

## Modifications:
* Compute the new phase: When the ball diffracts through the slit, we calculate a new phase shift (new_phase_shift) using the sine of the y-value at the diffraction point. This ensures the sine wave continues smoothly.

* Continuous trajectory: By adjusting the phase, the sine wave naturally "picks up" where it left off, avoiding a sudden jump or shift in the wave.

### How It Works:
Before Diffraction: The ball follows the normal sine wave trajectory.   
At Diffraction Point: When the ball passes through the slit, we calculate the angle (using the tangent) and adjust the wave's phase so that the sine wave continues smoothly, accounting for the diffraction effect.   
After Diffraction: The sine wave continues, but its phase has been shifted to ensure a smooth transition.   
This approach will ensure a more natural and continuous transition at the slit, without a noticeable shift or break in the wave trajectory.
